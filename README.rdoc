Ceaser Cipher test task.

=== Task description
Make an example app of 2 pages.

First page - user enters his name, clicks the button and the app
generates special unique link to him. (for example /cipher/abcdef).
By visiting this link user gets to the second page, where he can encode a
message using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
Basically, it is a header "Greeting, [username]", textarea, input for shift
integer and output block.
After user make a change to textarea it fires a delay timer of 0.5s and if
user makes no more changes to the textarea - it sends a request to
server which encodes the messages and displays it inside the output block.
Message should be persisted in the database, so when user visits his page
for the second time will be able to continue from the last saved state.

You get more points if you'll cover your application with automated tests.

You get more points if it is a single page application.

The description of the task might miss requirements - you are free to decide
the rest on your own.
